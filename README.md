Code for the computational model used for data generation and for the data analysis as described in "Emotion Regulation, Fast or Slow: A Computational Model of Strategy Choice".

The simulation studies were conducted in Python 3.9 (Van Rossum & Drake Jr, 1995). We used R 4.4.1 to analyze the generated data sets (R Core Team, 2021).
